Your god has abandoned this project.
Vampires, his children, burning in the desert.
Heightened appetites, can't be sated.
Angels, all fallen, nothing is sacred.

Burn down paradise, lost souls drifting to survive.

He's my oasis, my only comfort,
Why smile, why try, we're outnumbered.
Devour, be devoured, merciless nature.
Dark skies, black blizzard,
Run to the shelter.

Western Babylon, bones where gardens were hung.

At first the taste made us sick,
The blood of Christ, wine from the wrist.
Wine for the lost and derelict.

Burn down paradise, lost souls drifting to survive.
Western Babylon, bones where gardens were hung.
Your god, merciless nature, dark skies, black blizzard.
