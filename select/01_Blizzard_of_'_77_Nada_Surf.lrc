[00:15.57] In the blizzard of '77
[00:19.88] The cars were just lumps on the snow
[00:23.60] And then later
[00:25.94] Tripping in 7-11
[00:27.50] The shelves were stretching out of control
[00:31.17] On a plane ride
[00:33.67] The more it shakes
[00:35.77] The more i have to let go
[00:39.18] Now the signals
[00:41.33] Still getting all mixed up
[00:43.40] We're always doing damage control
[00:47.13] But in the middle of the night i worry
[00:50.50] It's blurry even without light
[00:53.62] I know i have got a negative edge
[01:07.84] That's why i sharpen all the others a lot
[01:12.24] It's like flowers or ladybugs
[01:18.64] Pretty weeds or red beetles with dots
[01:20.91] (Repeat)
[01:42.36] I miss you more than i knew
